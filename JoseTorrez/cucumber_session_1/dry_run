You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^goes to Customer page search$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When(/^I fill the search field$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When(/^I click on submit button$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then(/^The search result shows every customer with coincidences in the search$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
